## My process

- I structured the HTML starting with mobile first using grids.
- layed out the css using grids and flexbox
- worked out the javascript (it was only a few lines)

### Built with

- Non-Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Asynchronous Javascript

### What I learned

Some things I learned/refreshed on while working on this project:
- Centering elements on the page.
- Linking to an svg
- Using gradients
- Using border radius
- self invoking functions

### Continued development

Centering on this project was one of my biggest stuggles, Id like to touch up more on it in the future, other than that it was a fun project to work on.
